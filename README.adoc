Protocol documentation: http://eip.kokakiwi.net/doc/protocol.html

== Build environment

You need `multirust` to manage your Rust environment, which is available here: https://github.com/brson/multirust

TIP: There is an `AUR` package for Arch Linux: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/multirust

When you installed `multirust`, you need a specific Rust version for this project, which you can use by "overriding"
the Rust version for this project directory by using `multirust override <rust version>`

Actually, the needed Rust version is `{rustversion}`, which you can use by typing: `multirust override {rustversion}`

== Project rules

=== Versions

You *must* use specific versions of libraries and compiler, in order to avoid breaking changes problems.

NOTE: If using git URL for a library, specify the commit!

== Why not use stable Rust?
